# Neural-Network-and-Pytorch-Introduction
This course is a part of IBM AI engineering specialization which provides introduction to tensors, Pytorch datasets, optimization, differentiation and linear regression, cost calculation, derivatives and partial derivatives-Pytorch way. https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-networks-with-pytorch?specialization=ai-engineer
1D_tensor_V2 notebook covers the basics of tensor operations on 2D vectors.
Two_dimensional_tensor_v2 notebook covers the basics of tensor operations on 2D tensors 
DerivativesandGraphsinPytorch notebook covers the differentiation using Pytorch.
simple_data_set notebook covers basics of pytorch dataset creation and application of single and multiple transforms (such as addition and multiplication to the tensors) to the dataset object.
The dataset_and_transforms notebook demonstrate the dataset preparation and transforms applied to the image datasets.
